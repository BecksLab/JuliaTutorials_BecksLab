        "\n",
        "It is very worth pausing for a moment and visting [this paper](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210x.12713) by Dr. Eva Delmas. It describes the BioEnergetic Food Web Model, provides some history of the model, and also showcases how the original **Julia** version of the model worked.  This section of the tutorials is designed to introduce a newer, faster and more flexible version of the **Julia** package.\n",
        "\n",
        "A very basic interpretation of the model is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The model is a model of biomass dynamics, not numbers of indiduals.\n",
        "2. The model is comprised of an equation for plants (producers) an equation for consumers (herbivores, predators).\n",
        "3. Plants have traits that make their biomass grow and sets their carrying capacity; they are eaten by consumers via an equation describing a functional response.  To link to ecology courses you have, this can be logistic growth for the plant and a type II functional response.\n",
        "4. Consumer have three sets of traits.  One is metabolism, which is a rate that describes losses of biomass due to, well, metabolism!  The second set of traits correspond to the functional response - for example describing attack rates and handling times of prey items.  The third corresponds to the numerical response, or the conversion of biomass they eat into new biomass (e.g. babies)\n",
        "5. We can make complex networks and systems of these equations by letting many of these paramters _scale with body size_ via the rules of allometry and the Metabolic Theory of Ecology.  This _trick_ expands the two equations to n = number of species when we provide the toolbox with a list of species biomasses.\n",
        "6. Embedded in this process are rules about how to distribute species of different sizes across trophic levels, so that we end up with predators, omnivores, herbivores and plants.  We can also designate the body size relationships for different groups of organisms, like producers, invertebrates, endothermic vertebrates and ectothermic vertebrates.\n",
        "7. Once we've done this, we can simulate the biomass dynamics of complext communities.  And we can summarise things like changes in biodiversity (number of species), stability (coefficient of variation of the time series) and anything about the biomass of species, trophic levels or the community!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Preamble: Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "One of main advantages of running food web models in Julia is that simulations are fast and can be readily stored in your active project. With this in mind, make a new folder in your project called `out_objects` (right click > New Folder).\n",
        "\n",
        "### A first run of the Ecological Network Dynamics model (BEFW)\n",
        "\n",
        "There are four major steps when running the BioEnergetic Food Web model in Julia.  These should be familiar from our introduction to the `DifferentialEquations` package:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Generate an initial food web network\n",
        "2. Set the parameters for each species in the network to generate the equations\n",
        "3. Simulate the network and equations\n",
        "4. Explore output and plot\n",
        "\n",
        "While in the previous example with `Differential Equations` we assumed a simple 2-species network, one of the new activities here is to take advantage of a rich history of theory and tools to construct species rich networks with appropriate structural properties, such as _connectance/complexity_ and levels of _generalism/specialism_ and things the number of trophic levels and a body size distribtion of the species across trophic levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 1: generate an initial network\n",

Note that K is specified only for the basal species via `[1, 1, ... nothing, nothing]`.  All the producers have the same K at this point (1,1,1...). The presence of the `T` suggests that we can ultimately work with climate change by running the model at different temperatures.  There is a way to make some of the biorates and components of the functional response (see 3, 4) dependent not only on body mass, but also on temperature.\n",
        "3. the `biorates` component contains detail on parameters central to making the model reflect a bit of reality: `d` is ...; `r` is the intrinsic rate of increase (population growth rate) for the producers (plants); `x` and `y` are paramters associated with metabolic rates and consumption rates of the consumers (non-plant species).  Finally, `e` is an efficiency/assimilation rate for the consumers eating either plants or other animals.\n",
        "4. the `functional_response` component defines the type of _consumption function_ being used (e.g. Type I, II, or III sensu classic ecology and Holling).  The functional response defines the _interaction strength_ between species and how consumers change how much they eat dependent on the amount (density) of resource available.There are two options.  The default `Bioenergetic Response` corresponds to a _phenomenological_ formulation where there are just two variables that describe how consumer consumption varies with resource density: a _half-saturation_ parameter and an _asymptote_.  The alternative called `Classic Response` is more _trait based_ and includes the parameters _attack rate_ and _handling time_.  There are several other features of the functional response that can be manipulated, and these are introduced in later tutorials.\n",
